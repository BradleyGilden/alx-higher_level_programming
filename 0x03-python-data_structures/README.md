# Lists and Tuples

**This repository deals with Lists and Tuples found in Python as well as linked list technical interview prep**


## Directory Files:

* [0-print_list_integer.py](0-print_list_integer.py) - a function that prints all integers of a list
* [1-element_at.py](1-element_at.py) - a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
* [2-replace_in_list.py](2-replace_in_list.py) - a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
* [3-print_reversed_list_integer.py](3-print_reversed_list_integer.py) - a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order
* [4-new_in_list.py](4-new_in_list.py) - a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
* [5-no_c.py](5-no_c.py) - a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
* [6-print_matrix_integer.py](6-print_matrix_integer.py) - a function that prints a matrix of integers.
* [7-add_tuple.py](7-add_tuple.py) - a function that adds 2 tuples
* [8-multiple_returns.py](8-multiple_returns.py) - a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
* [9-max_integer.py](9-max_integer.py) - a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
* [10-divisible_by_2.py](10-divisible_by_2.py) - a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
* [11-delete_at.py ](11-delete_at.py ) - a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
* [12-switch.py](12-switch.py) - switch value of a and b
* [13-is_palindrome.c](13-is_palindrome.c) - a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
* [100-print_python_list_info.c](100-print_python_list_info.c) - a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.

## Lists:
* ordered data structures similar to arrays
* is mutable
* can list data of multiple types in a list, not restrictive like arrays
* able to increase and decrease in size at run time similar to linked lists, but not as good as linked lists in terms of time complexity.
* to initialize an list you can use:
  * mylist = []
  * mylist = list()


## Tuples
* Tuples are similar to lists with the only difference being that they are immutable. These are useful for items you dont want to change throughout your program.
* to initialize an tuple you can use:
  * mytuple = ()
  * mylist = tuple()
