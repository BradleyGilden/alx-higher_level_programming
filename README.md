# Higher Level Languages

**This repository contains Tasks assigned by the ALX_SE school to understand higher level programming languages and OOP starting with Python**

## Some interesing facts about Python:

- Python was intially intended as a hobby project, created by <i>Guido Van Rossum</i> in 1989
- Python was not named after a snake! Instead the name came from a Brittish comedy troupe that the creatory enjoyed, "Monty Python" from the late 70s.
- No braces or semi-colons
  - Unlike Java, C, C++, and C#, Python goes against the grain by only using indentation to identify the scope of code. This makes indentation and Structure crucial in Python.
- Python is shipped in various flavours:
  - **CPython**: Written in C, most common implementation of python.
  - **Jython**: Written in Java, compiles to bytecode.
  - **IronPython**: Implemented in C#.
  - **Brython**: Browser Python, runs in the browser
  - **RubyPython**: Bridge between Python and Ruby intepreters.
  - **PyPy**: Implemented in Python
  - **MicroPython**: Runs on microcontrollers
- Functions can return multiple values. This is not possible in languages like C where you can only use pointers or arrays as a work-around.
