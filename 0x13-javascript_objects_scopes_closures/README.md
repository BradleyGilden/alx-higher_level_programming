# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Directory FIles:

* [0-rectangle.js](0-rectangle.js) - an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
* [1-rectangle.js](1-rectangle.js) - a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
  * You must use the class notation for defining your class
  * The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
  * Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
  * Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
* [2-rectangle.js](2-rectangle.js) - a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
  * You must use the class notation for defining your class
  * The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
  * Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
  * Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
  * If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
  * Create an instance method called print() that prints the
  * rectangle using the character X
* [3-rectangle.js](3-rectangle.js) - a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
  * You must use the class notation for defining your class
  * The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
  * Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
  * Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
  * If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
  * Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle
  * using the character X
* [4-rectangle.js](4-rectangle.js) - a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
  * You must use the class notation for defining your class
  * The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
  * Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
  * Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
  * If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
  * Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
  * Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
  * Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2
* [5-square.js](5-square.js) - a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle
  * of 4-rectangle.js:
  * You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
  * The constructor must take 1 argument: size
  * The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())
* [6-square.js](6-square.js) - a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:
  * You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
  * Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle
  * using the character c
  * If c is undefined, use the character X
* [7-occurrences.js](7-occurrences.js) - a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list
* [8-esrever.js](8-esrever.js) - a function that returns the reversed version of a list
* [9-logme.js](9-logme.js) - a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value
* [10-converter.js](10-converter.js) - 
* []() - 
* []() -
