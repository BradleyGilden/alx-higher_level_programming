# Sets, Dictionaries and Lambda

**This directory contains tasks that aim in practicing the concepts of set and dictionary data structures as well as how to utilize Lambda with these data structures**

## Directory Files:

## Sets

Sets are unordered and unindexed. They do not contain or tolerate any duplicates. If a duplicate is found, the set will automatically remove it. They are recognised by the `{}` operator. In order to create an empty set you have to use the `set()` class

```Python3
>>> # Creating a set
>>> # my_set = {'dog, 'cat', 'frog', 'mouse'}
>>> fruit = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'apple']
>>> set(fruit)
{'banana', 'apple', 'orange'}
```

## Dictionaries
